# Makefile 2
#
# This makefile introduces some makefile syntax for identifying targets and
# dependencies. See readme.md for more details on the syntax used.

# As before we define the executable target "main" followed by its dependencies.
# On the second line we provide the build instructions using the "$@" to
# represent the target and "$^" to represent all of the dependencies.
main:	main.o print.o sphere_trig.o
	g++ -o $@ $^

# For building the objects we use "$<" to resprent the first dependency, i.e.
# the source file.
sphere_trig.o: src/sphere_trig.cpp
	g++ -c $<

# Same here,
print.o: src/print.cpp
	g++ -c $<

# and here.
main.o: src/main.cpp
	g++ -c $<

# Unchanged.
clean:
	rm *.o main
