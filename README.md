This tutorial is designed to provide a first look at using make and CMake to build C/C++ projects.

The level is aimed at users who have either never used these tools or have limited experience. More experienced users may also gain a slightly more concrete understanding of some of the syntax and features.

This tutorial is no way exhaustive and tutees are strongly encouraged to supplement their understanding with further reading.
